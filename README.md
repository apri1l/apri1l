### Hello!
My name is Abigail, I also go by Abby if you'd prefer to call me that.

I'm a casual JavaScript and Python developer from Australia, with additional (albeit partial) experience in Lua, Java, Squirrel, HTML/CSS and Assembly. I live on the Gold Coast, and maintain about 4 active jobs, so I'm a very busy person and don't have too much time to play games or develop stuff. Please bear this in mind!

As such, I don't have many (or at some points, any at all) public repositories, and only a few private repositories used to keep track of side projects. I'm sorry if this turns you away from me, but I'm always busy and don't have time to keep up with public projects.

#### Interesting Facts
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few private projects, namely a Discord bot and a modern recreation of an old video game
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Lua when I have time, as I find it an interesting language
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you want! I love to chat in my (small amounts of) free time with people, and have a very open attitude. Code, tech, food, etc. I have my own OC even if you're interested in anything along those lines ;)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: See the Contact section below
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I absolutely love Italian foods, and bouncey castles. Sometimes, I feel I never grew up.

#### Work
I am not usually available to do any kinds of jobs, but if you're interested in a small project, need some help or just want to have a chat, feel free to get in touch. My timezone is GMT+10 (AEST), and I'm not on 24/7, so response times may vary)

#### Contact
My main online point of contact is on Discord: Abigail#1337 (ID 463998476099780609)
Please check mutual servers before adding me as a friend - I am in some of the major bot and API servers and will be reachable from there.
